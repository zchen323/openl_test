           |-- pom.xml                                  Maven project file
           |
           |-- assembly                                 Maven assembly plugin configurations

           |     |
           |     |-- openl                              This folder contains all OpenL-related resources (rules, xml etc.)
           |     |  |-- rules.xml                       OpenL project descriptor (for OpenL only, generated in openl:generate maven goal)
           |     |  |-- rules
           |     |     |-- TemplateRules.xls            File with rules
           |     |
           |     |-- scripts
           |        |-- start.cmd                       Script that runs the Main class for Windows
           |        |-- start.sh                        Script that runs the Main class for Linux
           |
           |-- target/generated-sources/wrappers
              |-- myOpenlTest
                 |-- Wrapper.java                       An interface class which holds rules method definitions,WRAPPER CLASS
                                                        generated in openl:generate maven goal, used in Main.java

CONFIGURATION CHANGING

The "Main" java class demonstrates how can be used OpenL Tablets using file with rules directly. "rules.xml" also contains 
reference to it. If you need to make changes concerning rules file (e.g. rename, move) you have to maintain "rules.xml" manually.
